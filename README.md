## Introduction
Banks often run marketing campaigns to encourage people to open term deposits, which are savings accounts that earn interest.
In this project, we dive into bank's customer data to uncover what drives customers to engage with term deposit products. Our goal is to leverage these insights to refine the company's marketing efforts, customize services, and strengthen customer relationships. By analyzing demographics, financial behaviors, and interaction patterns, we aim to identify actionable strategies that can enhance the bank's offerings and foster growth.

## Methodology 
In this project, we adopt a structured approach to data analysis known as the *Data Analysis Process*. Here's a breakdown of the steps we'll follow:

1. Ask : Defining our goals and the questions we aim to answer with our analysis.
2. Prepare: Gathering our dataset from Kaggle and ensuring it's ready for analysis.
3. Process: Using Python to clean and preprocess our data, making it suitable for detailed examination.
4. Analyze: Delving into the data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that answer our initial questions.
5. Share: Visualizing our findings with Tableau, crafting a compelling narrative that conveys the story behind the data.
6. Act: Drawing conclusions and recommending actions based on our analysis to inform decision-making and strategy.# bank-marketing-campaign

## 1. Ask

**Business Objective**

The primary aim of this project is to enhance the effectiveness of the bank's marketing strategy for term deposit campaigns by identifying factors that influence customers' decisions to subscribe to term deposits. Understanding these factors will allow the bank to target the right customers more effectively and allocate resources more efficiently.

**Questions Driving the Analysis**

- Who subscribes?: Who are the customers that subscribe to term deposits (demographics, financial behavior, etc.?
- When do they subscribe?: Is there a pattern in terms of timing or customer lifecycle stage that influences subscription rates?
- How can we increase subscriptions?: Based on the characteristics of current subscribers, how can the bank tailor its marketing campaigns to convert non-subscribers?
